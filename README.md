This site is to provide the outside users to see my work and who am I. To give them a sense of who I am as a web developer. 
There are four pages: About Me, My Works, Deaf Culture, and Contact Me.

The introduction and my works page are to introduce myself to the world. Inside those pages where it included the contact information, pdf of my resume, technologies that I know how to use, and see my works. While the other half would be getting a sense of who am I. The Deaf culture is playing a big role for me and my life. So, it is fair enough to share with viewers. Plus, I wanted to share several extra icon-links where I and users(hopefully recruiters too) can break the ice to start the conversation with each other.

Technologies used in this site: HTML and CSS that's it. PHP just using for get it up and running online with heroku that's all.
